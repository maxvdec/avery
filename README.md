# The Avery Kernel

The Avery Kernel is a versatile, fast, and modern kernel written in Zig for the modern era, it is totally open-source and it aims to be the kernel for the XXI century.

## Features
* Fast boot
* GRUB booting
* VGA Interface
* Memory management
* Powerful interrupt system

## Roadmap (To Alpha)
I expect to add some things to this kernel before droping an alpha:

- [ ] Simple Graphics Library *(Catamaran)*
- [ ] Drivers for basic file systems *(FAT32, VFS)* **Work in progress**
- [ ] Simple USB Capabilties
- [ ] Audio Support
- [ ] A new shell *(Fusion)*
- [ ] Some GUI *(Gem)*
- [ ] A little range of system apps
- [ ] Networking capabilities
- [ ] User and Kernel Space
- [ ] Executable execution
- [ ] Custom bootloader *(Rouge)*
- [ ] System Calls

Then, I will expand the kernel to add more functionalities until make Avery, the modern successor of Linux.
