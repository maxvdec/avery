# The Avery Kernel

The Avery Kernel is a versatile, fast, and modern kernel written in Zig for the modern era, it is totally open-source and it aims to be the kernel for the XXI century.

# Features
* Fast boot
* GRUB booting
* VGA Interface
* Memory management
* Powerful interrupt system

## Roadmap (To Alpha)
I expect to add some things to this kernel before droping an alpha:

- [x] Drivers for basic file systems *(FAT32, VFS)*
- [ ] Simple USB Capabilties
- [ ] Audio Support
- [ ] A new shell *(Fusion)*
- [ ] Networking capabilities
- [x] User and Kernel Space 
- [x] Executable execution
- [ ] Custom bootloader *(Rouge)*
- [ ] System Calls **Work in progress**
- [ ] Support for more architectures
- [ ] Add support for driver management
- [ ] Create a standard library (libc)
- [ ] Add process schedueling
- [ ] Support multi-threading
- [ ] Support multiple process executing at the same time

Then, We will expand the kernel to add more functionalities until make Avery, the modern successor of Linux.
